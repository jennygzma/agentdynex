				For example, a response could be: To create an application where the user can store their notes app, I will create a gmail, table-like UI, that shows the "title" field of the note. The user can search for notes, delete notes, and add notes. When the user clicks on a row, they will be brought to the full note.

		There is no need for design mockups, wireframes, or external libraries. We just want to build a simple usable UI component. 
        All the code will be in React and MUI.
        Placeholder data already exists. There should be NO task for mocking placeholder data, or populating the cards with placeholder data, since that already exists.
		Format it like this: [{{"task_id: task_id, "task": task, "dep": dependency_task_ids}}]. 
		The "dep" field denotes the id of the previous tasks which generates a new resource upon which the current task relies.
		
		Please limit the plan to three to six steps.
